The Spatial Data Summary Tool is designed to analyze spatial datasets within a user-defined folder. It identifies all Shapefiles (.shp) and feature classes within Geodatabases (.gdb), determines their geometry type (Point, Line, or Polygon), counts the number of rows (features) and columns (fields), and compiles this information into a structured report.


This tool is useful for GIS analysts who need a quick overview of spatial datasets before further processing. The output is a text file report, saved in the specified output folder, which can be used for documentation, data auditing, or quality control.


Key Features:


Supports both Shapefiles and Geodatabase Feature Classes
Identifies geometry types (Point, Line, Polygon)
Counts the number of features (rows) and attributes (columns)
Saves results as a structured text report (.txt)
Automatically creates the output folder if it does not exist
